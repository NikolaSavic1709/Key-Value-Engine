# Key-value engine
This repository represents NoSQL key-value engine for big data made as a project for course of _Advanced algorithms and data structures_.  
Idea of this project was to implement algorithms and data structures in ``Golang`` and create console application for CRUD operations on pairs of key-value. Those algorithms and data structures are:  
- Bloom filter
- Count-min sketch
- HyperLogLog
- LRU cache
- LSM tree
- Memtable
- Merkle tree
- Skip list
- SStable
- Token bucket
- Write-ahead log  
  
This project was made in second year of faculty during winter semestar.
